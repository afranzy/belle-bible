[![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/:package.svg)](/LICENSE) 

## Introduction
This is a simple Single Page Application (SPA) to provide TTS service in Cantonese for Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) Bible as Chinese Union Version (CUV). This app makes use of [Angular](https://angular.io/) as a frontend framework and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) to fulfill [Material Design](https://material.io/) as visual principle.

## Prerequisites
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. Install Angular, [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), Angular Material
3. Register a TTS Service. Here we use a free service provided by [Voice RSS](http://www.voicerss.org/)
4. Install [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) for deploying a production build to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Getting Started

## A little bit about Angular CLI
### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
